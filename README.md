# Celluloid-Archive
Celluloid Archive is a movie-ranking website project designed with a retro pixelated theme. The idea behind this project is to create a playful, visually engaging platform for movie enthusiasts to browse, search, and rate their favourite films while offering a unique, nostalgic experience inspired by arcade games and 8-bit graphics.
