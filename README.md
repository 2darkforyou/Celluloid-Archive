# Celluloid-Archive
Celluloid Archive is a movie-ranking website project designed with a retro pixelated theme. The idea behind this project is to create a playful, visually engaging platform for movie enthusiasts to browse, search, and rate their favourite films while offering a unique, nostalgic experience inspired by arcade games and 8-bit graphics.

Project Overview
Name: Celluloid Archive
Type: Movie-Ranking Website
Theme: Pixelated retro design for a playful user experience.
Objective: Provide users with a fun and easy-to-use interface where they can browse movies, rate them, and filter by genre, all within a nostalgic, arcade-inspired visual framework.
Key Features
Movie Cards: Each movie is presented on a card with a poster, title, rating, and release date. The cards are interactive and respond to hover events (e.g., scaling up on hover to create a dynamic effect).
Search Bar: A central search feature allows users to quickly look up specific movies. The design is responsive and pixelated, keeping the retro vibe intact.
Genre Filter: A dropdown filter lets users browse movies by genre (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi, etc.), making the browsing experience more efficient.
Pixelated Design: The entire website design follows a retro arcade aesthetic with a pixelated font ('Press Start 2P'), grid layouts, and neon-like color schemes, including dark backgrounds and glowing accent colors.
Responsiveness: The layout is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes without losing its retro style, ensuring usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Design Elements
Typography: The site uses a pixelated font, 'Press Start 2P', which evokes a sense of nostalgia for old arcade games, while still maintaining readability.
Color Scheme:
Black Background: A dark background sets a cinematic tone, reminiscent of old CRT screens.
Neon Accents: Bright neon colors like electric blue, neon pink, and gold are used for text, stars, and interactive elements to create contrast and excitement.
8-bit Pixel Art: Small 8-bit icons, such as movie reels, stars, or rating indicators, further reinforce the retro theme and engage users visually.

User Experience (UX) Design
Interactive Movie Cards: The main interactive element is the movie card, which displays movie posters, star ratings, and release dates. On hover, these cards scale up, adding dynamic movement to the otherwise static design. This creates a game-like feel while remaining functional.
Search & Filter: To improve user navigation, the search bar is centrally located and allows users to quickly find movies by name. The genre filter dropdown helps organize the browsing experience.
Playful Animations: The website includes playful animations, such as hover effects on movie cards, text that "types out" letter by letter, and subtle glowing neon accents that mimic arcade-style interactivity.

Presentation & Process
1. Conceptualization:
The project began with brainstorming the idea of combining retro gaming aesthetics with a modern movie-ranking system.
Inspiration was drawn from classic websites like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, but with the twist of offering a visually nostalgic arcade-like experience.

3. Wireframing:
Early sketches and wireframes were created to map out how the homepage would look, where movie cards would go, and how the search bar and filter system would be laid out.
Wireframes helped finalize the three-column grid layout for movie cards and placement of interactive features.

5. Design & Prototyping:
Typography was chosen to evoke a pixelated retro style, reminiscent of 80s arcade screens.
Color palette: Dark backgrounds with neon colors were chosen to highlight text, buttons, and stars for ratings.
Icons: 8-bit style icons and images were created for elements like stars, search bars, and filters.

7. Development:
The website was built using HTML and CSS, with basic interactivity through JavaScript.
Movie posters were integrated as part of the movie cards, with each card featuring a title, star rating, and release date.
Hover animations and scaling effects were added to enhance the interactive experience of the movie cards.

9. Testing:
The website was tested on multiple devices to ensure responsiveness and usability.
The pixelated fonts were checked for readability, especially on smaller screens, to ensure the retro aesthetic didnâ€™t hinder user experience.

Challenges Faced:

Pixelated Fonts & Readability: One challenge was ensuring that the pixelated fonts (though visually consistent with the theme) were still readable, especially on mobile devices. Adjustments were made to font size and spacing to balance the retro feel with functionality.

Balancing Retro & Modern Elements: While maintaining the pixelated aesthetic, it was important to keep modern usability standards in mind. For example, making sure the search functionality was smooth and that the genre filter was easy to navigate.

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the grid layout, with its interactive movie cards, worked seamlessly across various screen sizes was a challenge. The solution was a fluid, responsive grid that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
